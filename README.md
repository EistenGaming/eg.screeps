# eg.screeps

We've recently stumbled over SCREEP on Steam and got hooked. Learning programming and solving problems has never been more fun :)

This is the code base we'll use to learn, improve and eventually go for (SCREEPS) world domination.

Our approach in three easy steps:

1) Learn the Screeps API
2) Write and incrementally improve the screep's AI
3) Dominate world
